## Abstract
By using the onboard sensing and external connectivity
technology, connected and automated vehicles (CAV)
could lead to improved energy efficiency, better routing, and
lower traffic congestion. With the rapid development of the
technology and adaptation of CAV, it is more critical to develop
the universal evaluation method and the testing standard
which could evaluate the impacts on energy consumption and
environmental pollution of CAV fairly, especially under the
various traffic conditions. In this paper, we proposed a new
method and framework to evaluate the energy efficiency and
emission of the vehicle based on the unsupervised learning
methods. Both the real-world driving data of the evaluated
vehicle and the large naturalistic driving dataset are used to
perform the driving primitive analysis and coupling. Then the
linear weighted estimation method could be used to calculate
the testing result of the evaluated vehicle. The results show
that this method can successfully identify the typical driving
primitives. The couples of the driving primitives from the
evaluated vehicle and the typical driving primitives from the
large real-world driving dataset coincide with each other very
well. This new method could enhance the standard development
of the energy efficiency and emission testing of CAV and other
off-cycle credits.
